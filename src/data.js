    The Island features a Polynesian-style restaurant that uses only the freshest local ingredients, including fish caught daily by hotel staff or nearby villagers. The resort also boasts a bar and deck, a swimming pool, an island-style tennis court, and beach volleyball equipment, as well as a pool table and table tennis within the main fale. In the evening, you can find yourself pullsided, enjoying a beautiful tropical music or sometimes even life performances. `

    Homes provided on the island include expansive, wrap-around veranda, welcomes guests into the main section of the house, which comprises an open-plan, extensive living room; kitchen with considerable storage space; opulently decorated dining room; and an ample pantry. The spacious living and dining area encourages sociability with a calming dichotomy that evokes freedom and intimacy in stark contrast to the phenomenal grandeur of the interior design.`
